Draft README for Patient Queries & Relevance Set [generated 26/03/2013]
=======================================================================

The query and result set are distributed as part of the CLEFeHealth 2013 Task 3: "Information retrieval to address questions patients may have when reading clinical reports".

The official training query and result set for Task 3 consists of 5 queries and corresponding result set generated from manual relevance assessment (by medical professionals) on a shallow pool.

This README for the query and relevance set provides specific details on the training queries and result set. It also provides a sample pseudo-query.


*****************************************************
Query and Result Set Details Summary:
-------------------------------------
-Training Set contains [released 15 April]:
--5 queries (queries1-5-train.xml) and associated result set (qrels.clef2013ehealth.1-5-train.bin.txt).

-Query Test Set contains [released 24 April]:
--50 queries.

-Result Set for Test Queries [released 1 June]:
--generated by pooling runs submitted by task participants on 1st May, and having nursing professionals conduct manual relevance assessment on the pooled sets.

Query Set Details:
------------------

The queries have been manually generated by medical professionals from highlighted disorders identified in Task 1 (a manually extracted set). A mapping between queries and task 1 matching discharge summary will be provided, the participants are free to get access to the discharge summary (https://sites.google.com/site/shareclefehealth/data#TOC-Obtaining-Datasets-Tasks-1-and-2-). It is not mandatory to obtain the tasks 1 and 2 datasets to participate in task 3 but it can be used as an external resource if desired.

Queries are distributed for use in Task 3 in an extended TREC style format, where title, description and narrative are as in the classic format and the additional fields are as follows: 

discharge_summary: matching discharge summary
profile: Information on the patient extracted from the discharge summary (that are relevant to the information sought by the patient)

The following example outlines what a query will look like in the collection:

<query>
  <id>q01</id>
  <discharge_summary>file2.txt</discharge_summary>
  <title>thrombocytopenia treatment corticosteroids length
  </title>
  <desc>How long should the corticosteroids treatment to cure thrombocytopenia be?
  </desc>
  <narr>Documents should contain information about treatments of thrombocytopenia, and especially corticosteroids. It should describe the treatment, its duration and how the disease is cured using it.</narr>
  <profile>The patient is a professional, female. She has a short-term disease, or has been hospitalised after an accident (little to no knowledge of the disorder, short term treatment)</profile>
</query>


*****************************************************
Result Set Details:
-------------------
Relevance assessments for these 5 training queries were formed based on pooled sets generated using the Vector Space Model and Okapi BM25. Pooled sets were created by taking the top 30 ranked documents returned by the two retrieval models with duplicates removed.
Relevance assessment has been performed by medical professionals. Relevance is judged on a 3-scale basis: Non relevant (0); Relevant (1). 

The relevance assessment are provided in standard TREC qrel format.
